Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

•	Across country, Theater is most successful crowdfunding campaign for parental category. Interestingly, Theater has most failed crowdfunding campaign as well. Considering rate of success rate per total campaign, journalism had highest success rate even though it only had total of 4 crowdfunding campaign. All 4 campaign was successful. Parental category games had highest failed rate, which had 23 failed campaigns out of 48 campaigns. 

•	Across country, Play is most successful crowdfunding sub-category. On the other hand, world music was the least successful crowdfunding sub-category. Excluding sub-category of least amount of campaign, audio and world music, translation was a sub-category with highest rate of success. Science fiction was a sub-category with highest rate of failure. 

•	Crowdfunding created on July was most successful, compared to other months. Crowdfunding created on January had most failed campaign compared to other months. 
 
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

•	These data were pulled from different country, which implies that there were cultural variance and population preference on interest. Median income of each country is also not available, which may indicate general population’s ability to support crowdfunding compared to other county. Also, It is unclear whether these crowdfunding was available through same Crowdfunding website, or different platforms. 

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and 
what additional value would they provide?

•	Instead of number of outcomes, percentage of success, fail, live, and canceled campaign of each parental category may show better perspective which campaign had tendency to drop out, compared to other category. This will show success rate, not just count of outcome. 
•	We can add tables and graphs for currency – pivot table and have a 
chart listing TRUE and FALSE from staff pick and spotlight and the 
difference. 

Bonus
1. Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the
data more meaningfully.

•	When comparing failed and success range of minimum and maximum, both median and mean is heavily right skewed. In this case, both failed and success campaign has big outlier on higher number (maximum), therefore median would summarize data more meaningfully compared to mean, which can heavily be affected by outliers. 
2. Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful of 
unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

•	Since both variance and standard deviation is larger for successful campaign data, therefore it does make sense that there is more variability with successful campaigns. Due to high variance and standard deviation, interquartile range might be important to consider as a level of measurement.
